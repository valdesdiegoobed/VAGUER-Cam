# xCam - Universal Virtual Camera Xposed Module

**xCam** is a high-performance, universal Xposed module built with the modern **LibXposed API (API 101)**. It allows users to replace live camera feeds and actual photo captures with virtual media sources across a wide range of Android applications, from legacy devices to the latest Android 16.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Universal OS Support (Android 9 - 16)**: Built with a hybrid architecture that automatically adapts to the device's API level (API 28 to API 37).
- **Supports**:
    - **Legacy (API 28-30)**: Uses high-stability Camera1 hooks and Legacy Camera2 `produceFrame` hijacking for Android 9, 10, and 11.
    - **Modern (API 31-37)**: Features **Surgical Diversion** and **OutputConfiguration Swapping** to bypass the strict security of Android 12 through Android 16.
- **Universal Capture**: A revolutionary `BitmapFactory` interception system that ensures 100% success in replacing captured photo data across almost any application.
